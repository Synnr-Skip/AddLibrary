# AddLibrary
Add latest versions of css/js libraries in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), searching for libraries hosted at CDN's and creating a folder called `libs` on the root of your folder, and downloading libs inside there.

- Find your Packages directory using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
- Copy the folder into your Sublime Text Packages directory
